// Your task is to create a simple linked list implementation.
// You can find the theory in Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list
// LinkedList should support insertion (simple and after / before node), deletion and search
// Once you are done with this you should create a double linked list. What's the benefit in that?
// Other extension goals: Circular Linked List, Circular Double Linked list
